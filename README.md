# Intro to Systems and Networks Programming Challenge 2

**Objective:** Extend the provided basic web server (HTTP_Server.c) by adding functionality to break down the HTTP request from the client into method, URL, and protocol variables, and then write a concatenated response that includes these variables along with a "Hello, world!" message.

**Summary:** The challenge involves enhancing a basic web server to parse HTTP requests and generate appropriate responses, demonstrating understanding of basic web server functionality and string manipulation in C. 

*Note: This code was written and tested on Mac and the directions are written based on that.* 

**Directions:**
    <ul>
    <li> Clone the Directory from the terminal: </li>
        **```git clone https://github.com/IamPoojaP/Intro-S-N-Programming-Challenge-2.git```**
    <li>Type **```make```** in the terminal </li>
    <li>Open 2 terminal One for the ```Server``` and another for the ```Client``` </li>
    <li>On the Server Terminal type **```./HTTP_Server```** to run it</li>
    <li>On the Client Terminal type **```./HTTP_Client```** to run it</li>
    </ul>
